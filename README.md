# Entcontrol-Extension

The 'EntControl' plug-in is a Sourcemod-Plugin for people who want to control their servers as good as possible. By editing/spawning/grabbing the worlds entities.

 * Spawn things like props, weapons, bombzone, NPCs, ...
 * You can easily add new Entities by editing the configfile - NO need to recompile the plugin!
 * Modify every entity ... make it breakable, invisible, unsolid, remove it, touch it, ...
 * Rotate entities
 * Use one of the powerful weapons (shoot rockets, fire ioncannon, TV-MISSILE)
 * Reads Entity-Outputs like the OnPressed Event from a func_button
 * None-Admins are able to pickup props with +USE
 * Spawn Portals
 * Fixed Guns
 * Extract files from .vpk-files
 * Webinterface using an integrated webserver.
 * Accessing hiding-spots from .nav-files

This is the sourcecode for the optional extension. The real Entcontrol-plugin can be found under https://github.com/LeGone/Entcontrol-Extension
